**Why coffee enema?**

We have an inportant vein in our intestinal tract called hepatic portal vein (HPV). It is a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointernal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. This blood contains nutrients and toxins that are extraacted from digested contents.

There are 3 main things in coffee enemas that are important

- Palmitic Acid
- Caffeine
- Water

When palmitic acid is absorved throught the veins, what it does is it stimulates a liver enzyme called glutathione S-transferase (GST). It is the main enzyme that detoxes our bodies. When we have coofee in enema this enzyme is stimulated 6.5x. 

Detox nowadays is a big industry and everyone is trying to make money off it - mainly juice companies. To understand and create an effective detox we must first understand what is the toxin we are trying to get rid of.

6 Categories of toxins we come in contact with everyday:

1. Free radicals (Atom that is missing one electron)
  - Highly unstable
  - From food, stress, environment
  - GST has a group in the molecule that has one extra electron that can be used to fill up the free radical missing electron. *Covalent bond*
2. Pesticides, insecticides, chemicals in farming
  - Estimated 5 pounds of pesticides consumed by each person during a year
  - Liver is the only organ that filters this
3. Zenobiotics (Drugs that are foreign to our body)
  - Antibiotics
  - Ibuprofen
  - etc...
4. Food additives
  - 10k FDA approved food additives
  - Preservatives, food coloring, BHT/BHA, nitrites, aspertame(fake sugar)
5. Food we eat
  - MCdonalds (Cows are eating GMO food)
  - Animals with growth hormones
  - Animals with antibiotics
  - Transfat (French fries)
6. Bilirubin (Dead red cells)

The liver is the only organ that can take care of them. Coffe enemas stimulate the liver to produce GST that neutralize the toxins present in our body.

The caffeine dialates the bial ducts (roughly 20%). Water dilutes the bial.

Selecting the right coffee.

When the liver cant process these toxins they get stored in fat and connective tissues.

Raw Soil: 52 Nutrients/Minerals


**Why supplement?**

1. Potassium
  - When cancer/sick you dont have anough potassium in your body
  - Potassium acetate & glucanate & phosphate in equal proportions (10% diluted solution)
2. Iodine
  - Food for thyroid gland - thyroxine  (hormone)
  - Makes body produce ATP
  - When cancer sees iodine it absorbs it. Iodine allows cells to absorb minerals quicker
3. Digestive enzymes
4. Co-ezyme Q10 (Ubiquonol)
  - We need it to process food
  - After 25 yrs old it starys to decline
  - 300mg everyday
5. Vitamin B
  - Open up capilaries (Dilate)
  - Allows toxins to be excreted and good nutrition to come in
  - Take throughout the day
6. Milk thistle
  - 28 days to renew skin
  - 2 years to renew liver cells
  - Helps speed up liver metabolism
  - Stimulates GST
  - 8 pills everyday
7. Gut flora
  - 10 T cells
  - 100 T bacteria
  - Aids digestions
  - Produces enzymes that body needs
8. Vitamin C

VITAMINS FROM NATURAL SOURCES! - Not produced in a lab synthetically
